              First and foremost this website is a bread recipe scaler.
              Want to try a new bread recipe but don't want to make 20
              rolls? Enter your recipe and then enter the amount of dough
              you need and voilà! The new measurements for the recipe
              get printed to new inputs. This will reliably scale up or
              down any bread recipe you have.
            </p>
          </div>

              I learned to bake bread in 2020 and I've been baking ever
              since. I learned to scale recipes by hand but then I thought
              to myself, "Self. You're a web dev why don't you make a web
              app that does this for you?" So here it is.

              I also enjoy making software. Most of my experience has been on the web
              but I've done a little bit of everything. I started out as a
              C# dev in 2018, as an intern and my first real job was a Java shop but
              after that I noticed a trend in the company I was working at
              where the devs on my team were regularly not interested in
              doing the frontend work so I took it upon myself to own the
              frontend on that team and I've stayed on the frontend ever since.
            </p>
            <p>
              My expertise is in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. When it comes
              to JavaScript frameworks I've only used React but I would
              consider myself very knowledgeable about frontend code regardless
              of framework. The web did exist before the frameworks after all.
              I'm confident I can work in any JavaScript framework there is.
              I'm passionate about accessibility, I really enjoy building
              web pages that can be traversed with the keyboard because that
              is how I prefer to surf the web myself, no mouse necessary.
              I also enjoy thinking about how to make the user experience
              more enjoyable, intuitive and less frustrating. If you want to 
              know specifics about my work history feel free to download my CV! 
              Hope you enjoy the site. I've been maintaining it regularly now 
              for a year. I have a roadmap to add several features that
              will make it easier to use and help me expand my knowledge and skillset.
