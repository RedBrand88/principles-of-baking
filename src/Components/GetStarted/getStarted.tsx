        Get started with baking bread can be <WaveText text='easy' />. If you don't have any specialized equipment yet
        you can start with a simple recipe that doesn't require any special tools. And as you learn,
        you can decide if you want to invest in more tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most important thing to have is a kitchen scale. This will help you measure your ingredients
        accurately and consistently. You can find a kitchen scale at most stores that sell kitchen equipment.
        They are fairly inexpensive and will last you a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next thing you need is a bowl to mix your ingredients in. You can use a glass or metal bowl, or a
        plastic container. Just make sure it's big enough to hold all your ingredients.
      </p>

        This first recipe you'll learn I'll give you the ingredients in <WaveText text='cups' /> and 
        {' '}<WaveText text='tablespoons' /> {' '}as well as grams. But as you get more comfortable with 
        baking, you'll want to switch to using grams for more consistent results.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are the ingredients you'll need for your first bake:
        <ul>
          <li>4 cups of Bread Flour</li>
          <li>1 and 2/3 teaspoons of Salt</li>
          <li>2 and 1/3 teaspoons of Instant Dry Yeast</li>
          <li>1 and 1/2 cups of Water</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        You'll also need a baking vessel. You can use a dutch oven, a baking stone, or a baking sheet. 
        If you don't have any of these, you can use a cast iron skillet with a lid or a large pot with a lid.
      </p>
