      <h2>Kneading</h2>
      <p>
        Kneading is the process of working the dough to develop the gluten. Gluten is a protein that gives the dough
        structure and elasticity. Kneading also helps to evenly distribute the yeast, salt, and other ingredients
        throughout the dough.

        without gluten, the dough would not be able to rise properly and would be dense and flat. Kneading is
        essential for most bread recipes if you plan to make the dough the same day. This task will be made easier
        if you have a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment.

        if you don't have a stand mixer, you can knead the dough by hand. To knead by hand, there is no right
        or wrong way to do it. The dough just needs to be worked until it is smooth and elastic. This can take
        10-15 minutes. You can also use the windowpane test to check if the dough is ready. To do this, take a small
        piece of dough and stretch it between your fingers. If the dough stretches thin enough to see light through it
        without tearing, it is ready. If it tears, continue kneading.

        if you use a lower protein flour with a high hydration recipe the dough will be stickier and harder to work
        and will require more kneading. If you use a higher protein flour with a lower hydration recipe, the dough
        will be easier to work and will require less kneading. This problem can be exacerbated if you are using oil
        or butter in the recipe. The fat will coat the gluten strands and make it harder for them to develop. If you
        are having trouble kneading the dough, try letting it rest for 10-15 minutes and then continue kneading.

      <h3>How to Knead</h3>
      <p>
        This section will go over how I knead dough by hand. There are many ways to knead dough, and you may find
        a different method that works better for you. So use that instead. But if you are new to kneading, this
        method is a good place to start.

        Slap and fold method:
        <ol>
          <li>Flour your work surface and hands.</li>
          <li>Place the dough on the floured surface.</li>
          <li>Using both of your hands scoop under the dough so that your two middle fingers touch one another under
            the dough.</li>
          <li>Lift the dough off your work surface so it folds over your hands</li>
          <li>Then slap the side closest to you onto the counter</li>
          <li>Then turning your hands 90 degrees relative to the dough repeat all the steps</li>
        </ol>

        This method is good for wet doughs because it requires less direct contact with the dough. If you are
        having trouble with the dough sticking to your hands, try wetting your hands with water instead of flouring
        them. This can help prevent the dough from sticking to your hands.

        But trust the process, After 10 to 15 minutes the dough should be smoother and more stretchy than when you
        started.

      <h2>No-Knead Technique</h2>
      <p>
        If you aren't interested in kneading, then you don't have to. But there is a trade-off. The dough will not be ready
        to bake the same day. Instead, you will have to let the dough rest for a long period of time. This can be achieved
        during cold bulk fermentation or a long room temperature rest if you are using a preferment and wont add the levain
        until the next day.
      </p>
      <p>
        This process is called autolyse. Autolyse is a rest period that allows the flour to fully hydrate and the gluten
        to develop without kneading. This can take anywhere from 30 minutes to 4 hours. The longer the rest, the less
        kneading is required. I have mixed together the flour, salt and water in a bowl. Then I let it rest covered at room
        temperature overnight. The next day I add the levain whether it be a sourdough starter or a poolish. Then I mix
        the dough until the levain is fully incorporated. Then I do the final fermentation and shaping. This method is
        great for beginners because it is less hands-on and requires less skill. But it does require more time and
        planning ahead.
