        The next lesson will cover fermentation. Fermentation is the process of yeast consuming sugars and producing
        carbon dioxide and alcohol.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is what makes bread rise. The yeast consumes the sugars in the flour and produces carbon dioxide gas.
        The gluten in the flour traps the gas and the dough rises.
      </p>
      <p>
        The alcohol produced by the yeast gives the bread its flavor. The longer the fermentation the more alcohol
        is produced and the more flavor the bread has.
      </p>
      <p>
        For those who don't drink alcohol, the alcohol is burned off during baking so there is no alcohol in the final
        product.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fermentation time is affected by the temperature of the dough. The warmer the dough the faster the
        fermentation. The cooler the dough the slower the fermentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fermentation time is also affected by the amount of yeast in the dough. The more yeast the faster the
        fermentation. The less yeast the slower the fermentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fermentation time is also affected by the amount of sugar in the dough. The more sugar the faster the
        fermentation. The less sugar the slower the fermentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The longer the fermentation the more flavor the bread has. The shorter the fermentation the less flavor the
        bread has.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bulk fermentation is the first fermentation that happens after the dough is mixed. This is when the dough
        doubles in size. This can take 1 to 2 hours depending on the temperature of the dough.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cold bulk fermentation is when the dough is placed in the refrigerator to ferment. This can take 8 to 24
        hours depending on the temperature of the refrigerator. This is used to develop more flavor in the bread.
        and it can really help you make bread fit into your schedule.
      </p>
      <p>
        The final fermentation is the fermentation that happens after the dough is shaped. This is when the dough
        rises to the final size before baking. This can take 1 to 2 hours depending on the temperature of the dough.
      </p>
      <p>
        A very common pattern I use is to mix the dough in the evening and let it bulk ferment in the refrigerator
        overnight. I wake up follow my normal morning routine and go to work. When I get home from work I shape the
        dough and let it rise while I make dinner. Then I bake the bread after dinner to enjoy a nice homemade loaf
        during the week.
      </p>
      <p>
        This means I don't have to babysit a sourdough starter or spend all day making bread. I can make bread that
        is more flavorful than store bought bread and doesn't require a lot of time.
